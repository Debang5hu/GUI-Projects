A Password Generator(GUI) made in python (3.11)  

---  

## How It Works:  

1. It takes the length of the password as input and generate random password using __random.choice()__ of the provided length 

2. It also allow the user to save password in a text file(though not a secure way) for future use  

3. It generates a secure password by implementing a length check of the password [should be more than 12]  

4. It provides __clipboard integration__ to copy the password easily from the screen  

5. Also allow the user to add password rule like excluding certain character types. [To exculde (uppercase:upper/u) || (lowercase:lower/l) || (digit:digit/d) || (punctuation:punctuation/p) ]
